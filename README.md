### Java AWT Simple Calculator

This repository contains a Java program that implements a basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). The calculator allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Utilizes Java AWT components (`Frame`, `TextField`, `Button`, `Panel`) to create a user-friendly calculator interface.
  
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
  
- **Decimal Point:** Allows users to input decimal numbers for precise calculations.
  
- **Clear and Clear Entry:** Provides functionality to clear the entire calculation (`C`) or clear the last entered digit (`CE`).
  
- **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" on division by zero or invalid input.

#### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
  
#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-awt-simple-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd java-awt-simple-calculator
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Program:**
   ```bash
   javac SimpleCalculatorAWT.java
   ```

4. **Run the Calculator Application:**
   ```bash
   java SimpleCalculatorAWT
   ```

#### Usage

- Input numbers and perform arithmetic operations using the calculator's graphical interface.
  
- Click the buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `.`) to perform operations.
  
- Use the `C` button to clear all input and calculations.
  
- Use the `CE` button to clear the last entered digit.
  
- Press `Enter` or click `=` to calculate the result.
